# SLR-Using-Python

## **Modelling the linear relationship between Salary and Percentage in the used dataset**
### **Introduction**
Here I have built a Simple Linear Regression Model to study the linear relationship between Percentage and Salary dataset.I have given a small info on the basics of linear regression and its implementation in Python Programming Language using Scikit-Learn.

### **Python Libraries**
I did this SLR in Juypter Notebook (Anaconda Distributed)
The basic python libraries used here are:-

**-NumPy** : It is the fundamental package for **scientific computing** in Python.
    
**-Pandas** : Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source **data analysis and manipulation tool**, built on top of the Python programming language.

**-Scikit-Learn** : It features various **classification, regression and clustering algorithms.**

**-Matplotlib** : It is a **plotting library** for the Python programming language.

**-statsmodels** : It is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models.

**-SciPy** : is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. 

### **Linear Regression**
Linear Regression is a statistical technique which is used to find the linear relationship between dependent and one or more independent variables.This technique is applicable for Supervised Learning Regression problems where we normally try to predict a continous variable.

### **Simple Linear Regression**
Simple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two quantitative variables.It is used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. Often, the objective is to predict the value of an output variable (or response) based on the value of an input (or predictor) variable.
#### **Homoscedasticity**
In regression analysis , homoscedasticity means a situation in which the variance of the dependent variable is the same for all the data. Homoscedasticity is facilitates analysis because most methods are based on the assumption of equal variance.

### **Residual Analysis**
Residuals are differences between the one-step-predicted output from the model and the measured output from the validation data set. Thus, residuals represent the portion of the validation data not explained by the model.
Residual analysis is used to assess the appropriateness of a linear regression model by defining residuals and examining the residual plot graphs.
